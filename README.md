# Data source :
Ford GoBike System Data : https://www.fordgobike.com/system-data This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area .

# Features :
Trip Duration (seconds) , Start Time and Date , End Time and Date , Start Station ID , Start Station Name , Start Station Latitude , Start Station Longitude , End Station ID , End Station Name, End Station Latitude , End Station Longitude , Bike ID , User Type (Subscriber or Customer – “Subscriber” = Member or “Customer” = Casual) , Member Year of Birth, Member Gender

# Questions to be answered:
1.How long does the average trip take?

2.Is the trip duration affected by weather( months/seasons)

3.Does the above depend on if a user is a subscriber or customer?

# Summary of findings :
As trip duration significantly influences the revenue of the bike share company, I conducted an investigation to identify the key factors impacting it. Surprisingly, weather does not have a significant effect on trip duration, whereas user type does. The analysis revealed that subscribers tend to utilize the bikes for longer trips, typically exceeding 250 minutes. To enhance revenue, an effective strategy would be to attract more potential customers and encourage existing customers to become subscribers.
